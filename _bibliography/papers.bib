abstract = {Most video-based learning content is designed for desktops without considering mobile environments. We (1) investigate the gap between mobile learners’ challenges and video engineers’ considerations using mixed methods and (2) provide design guidelines for creating mobile-friendly MOOC videos. To uncover learners’ challenges, we conducted a survey (n=134) and interviews (n=21), and evaluated the mobile adequacy of current MOOCs by analyzing 41,722 video frames from 101 video lectures. Interview results revealed low readability and situationally-induced impairments as major challenges. The content analysis showed a low guideline compliance rate for key design factors. We then interviewed 11 video production engineers to investigate design factors they mainly consider. The engineers mainly focus on the size and amount of content while lacking consideration for color, complex images, and situationally-induced impairments. Finally, we present and validate guidelines for designing mobile-friendly MOOCs, such as providing adaptive and customizable visual design and context-aware accessibility support.},

abstract = {Mobile video-based learning attracts many learners with its mobility and ease of access. However, most lectures are designed for desktops. Our formative study reveals mobile learners’ two major needs: more readable content and customizable video design. To support mobile-optimized learning, we present FitVid, a system that provides responsive and customizable video content. Our system consists of (1) an adaptation pipeline that reverse-engineers pixels to retrieve design elements (e.g., text, images) from videos, leveraging deep learning with a custom dataset, which powers (2) a UI that enables resizing, repositioning, and toggling in-video elements. The content adaptation improves the guideline compliance rate by 24\% and 8\% for word count and font size. The content evaluation study (n=198) shows that the adaptation significantly increases readability and user satisfaction. The user study (n=31) indicates that FitVid significantly improves learning experience, interactivity, and concentration. We discuss design implications for responsive and customizable video adaptation.},

Furthermore, many of the current efforts by service providers to automatically filter offensive language are vulnerable to users{'} deliberate text manipulation tactics, such as misspelling words. In this study, we analyze offensive language patterns in real logs of 6,254,261 chat utterance pairs from the commercial chat service Simsimi, which cover a variety of conversation topics. Based on the observed patterns, we introduce a novel offensive language detection method{---}a contrastive learning model that embeds chat content with a random masking strategy. We show that this model outperforms existing models in detecting offensive language in open-domain chat conversations while also demonstrating robustness against users{'} deliberate text manipulation tactics when using offensive language. We release our curated chatbot dataset to foster research on offensive language detection in open-domain conversations and share lessons learned from mitigating offensive language on a live platform.",

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements have transformed digital banking by offering services such as personalized recommendations and interactive chatbots. However, only some AI systems target older adult users, given their relatively low usage of digital banking. Conversely, older adults may benefit the most from AI as handling finances becomes increasingly crucial after retirement. Our paper aims to fill this gap by 1) understanding the everyday financial concerns of older adults near retirement age and 2) exploring interests and needs in AI supporting their financial concerns. To understand the perspectives of older adults regarding the support of financial needs with AI, we conducted co-design workshops with 14 older adults. Our findings revealed three key concerns: retirement planning, grown children’s education and marriage expenses, and family healthcare costs. Also, participants were willing to use AI to glean the financial information they lacked and grow self-efficacy. Finally, we discuss the design opportunities of using AI to support older adults’ financial decisions.},

abstract = {Personality assessments provide insights into understanding individual differences. In HCI, personality assessments are used to model user behavior or tailor user interfaces. However, conventional Likert-scale personality tests face issues in user engagement and capturing comprehensive personality nuances. Building upon prior work using conversational user interfaces for personality prediction, we delve deeper into personalized personality tests. Through a formative study (n=4), we identified three design goals for user engagement. Informed by these goals, we propose a novel architecture integrating multiple large language model agents to support free-form conversation-based personality assessment. Our system, ChatFive, predicts users’ Big Five traits through real-time personalized dialogue. Evaluations from our user study (n=20) revealed that ChatFive significantly improved conveying true responses and felt more engaged, though requiring longer response times and different validation. We discuss the limitations on the validity of ChatFive and its implications.},

abstract = {While measuring socioeconomic indicators is critical for local governments to make informed policy decisions, such measurements are often unavailable at fine-grained levels like municipality. This study employs deep learning-based predictions from satellite images to close the gap. We propose a method that assigns a socioeconomic score to each satellite image by capturing the distributional behavior observed in larger areas based on the ground truth. We train an ordinal regression scoring model and adjust the scores to follow the common power law within and across regions. Evaluation based on official statistics in South Korea shows that our method outperforms previous models in predicting population and employment size at both the municipality and grid levels. Our method also demonstrates robust performance in districts with uneven development, suggesting its potential use in developing countries where reliable, fine-grained data is scarce.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
